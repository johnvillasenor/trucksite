        <p> Roadstar Trucking was started in 2001 by Daniel Tarango. Initially starting with one 20 yard end dump truck. <br>
            We contract work for independent contractors. We have trucks specializing in contruction and demolition. On average, <br>
            about 60-10 trucks go out daily. We run 10 yard tandems, 20 yard end dumps, and 60 yard demolition trailers. We also <br>
            have access to belly dumps and tri-axle trailers. Our job is to provide the most cost-efficient transportation while <br>
            offering the highest quality service available. We haul: dirt, gravel, sand, rock, concrete, asphalt, and<br>
            anything that goes in and out of a contruction site. We also help companies attain operational excellence by<br>
            providing transportation solutions tailored for their individual needs. Our years of experience have taught <br>
            us that “a one size fits all” type of transportation does not work in this complex and ever changing industry. Companies<br>
            need real-time information from their suppliers to their end-user, which helps them reduce lead times and optimize<br>
            their inventory while reducing transportation costs. The reason for our continued growth and success is due to making<br>
            our customers satisfaction our number one goal at Road Star. </p>
