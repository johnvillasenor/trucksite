Hi there.
This folder is here to help with database testing with phpmyadmin.


You must create a database using the name users_tc.
You may implement the tables and some example data by importing users_tc.sql.


You can connect to the database with XAMPP if you create the following user:
Username: testadmin
Password: roadrunners
